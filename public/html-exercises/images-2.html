			Well, first of all that isn't the picture of me. I wasn't able to find my baby picture so I just added that picture.
			When I was a baby I was in South Korea and I came to the Philippines when I was four. 
			My first language was a bit of Korean and I started learning english on the first time in school when I first entered school in the PHILIppines at Kindergarten.

			Well, that isn't my only picture in high school but that was me when I was on the fourth year of Highschool.
			I graduated in CDLB in Los Banos. I went to Korea and the Philippines for my previous years of Highschool.
