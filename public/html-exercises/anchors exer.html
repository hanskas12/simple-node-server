		<em>My Top 3 movie Picks </em>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The third spot goes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(film_series)"> Rush hour series. </a>
		 I like this movie because of Jackie chan. he is a really good actor and the story is good and the black man in the movie is also funny. I 			really enjoyed this movie a lot when I watched it when I was young.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Next is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsman:_The_Secret_Service"> Kingsman: The secret service. </a>
		 I like this movie because the story is good and the way how they filmed this action movie was unexpecting and new. I enjoyed the movie a lot 			and I would like to watch the movie more if I can. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bucket_List"> The Bucket list. </a>
		 I really enjoyed this movie. I really like the story and the actors. The story had a big meaning and I really liked that there would be a 			list of somethings you would like to do before you die and it is called the "Bucket List."

		 <em> The Top 3 Songs of my playlist </em>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 Actually My favorite songs are in Korean since I am a Korean but I would just list pop songs which i like.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 The thirs spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Cti12XBw4"> Sunday Morning. </a>
		  I just like the rythm and the song itself. I listened to this song a lot and I enjoy listening to it.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZEszY90cxI"> She will be Loved. </a>
		  I like this song itself also but I like it more than Sunday Morning because it is telling that a girl will be loved and it is sweet.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL4uhaQ58Rk"> Lost Stars. </a>
		  I like this song most because it is a song from the movie "Begin again." and it is also a song for the girl he loved.
